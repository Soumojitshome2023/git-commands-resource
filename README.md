## 🛠️ Advanced Operations

### 🔄 Sync with Master (via Rebase)
To update your branch with a specific commit hash from the master branch:
```bash
git fetch origin master            # Fetch latest changes
git checkout <your-branch>         # Switch to your branch
git rebase <commit-hash>           # Rebase on specific commit
# Resolve conflicts if they occur
git rebase --continue              # Continue after conflict resolution
git push --force-with-lease        # Safely force push to remote
```

### 🏷️ Rename a Branch
To rename a branch both locally and on the remote:
```bash
# 1. Rename locally
git branch -m <new-name>

# 2. Delete old branch on remote
git push origin --delete <old-name>

# 3. Push new branch and set upstream
git push origin <new-name>
git push --set-upstream origin <new-name>
```

### 🔀 Merging Feature into Master
```bash
git checkout master                # Switch to master
git pull origin master             # Get latest master
git merge <your-branch>            # Merge your branch
# Resolve conflicts manually if any, then:
git add .
git commit -m "Merge <your-branch> into master"
git push origin master             # Push to remote
```
